# Every property in Super Mario Maker (1 & 2) 

A simple project made to retrieve most (if not every) properties in the game Super Mario Maker 2 as well as some hidden information on its predecessor (on the WiiU).

This project is intended to be a simple project to help to research and give great simple details about every entities (and projectiles) within the game. It has also the intent to give more than one language (English, French, Spanish, Japanese and more).


## Development for the web application
### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure that `npm` is installed.

Then, from there,
 - run `npm install` to install the `node_modules` package

### Run the project locally (desktop and mobile)

To run the project, the command `npm start` is the only thing to do.
 - It will start the development mode.
 - It will also reload if any edits is made
 - In the console, it will display any lint errors 

By default, it will open it in the default browser automatically. If it has not worked, then, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to display the application.
If it needs to be tested on other devices than the local machine, there will be another address. An example could be [192.168.4.20:3000](http://192.168.4.20:3000).

### Running tests

The command to execute the tests is `npm test`.

Then, from  that, it will start an interactive watch mode.
For more details, see [how to run the tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### Prepare the final build

In order to create a production build, the command to execute is `npm run build`.
 - It will minify the files
 - The files will include the hashes.

The application will ready to compile once this is done.
For more details, see the [application's deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
